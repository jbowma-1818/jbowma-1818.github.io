# Hi, I'm Justin üëã

I'm a Computer Science graduate from Clemson University with experience in software development, data analytics, and healthcare-focused research.

I build things that solve real problems, from web apps and data tools to process automation. I like taking messy processes (manual data entry, confusing workflows, paper-based anything) and turning them into something fast, clear, and usable.
